# Pure-Pursuit

This is FRC 6814's Pure Pursuit Autonomous Code. This project is inspired by 1712's Pure Pursuit Implementation on Chief Delphi.

There are two main parts of this code: Path Generator, and Path Follower. There's also a Tester (simulator) that simulates the pure pursuit driving. (Comment out logger WPI related code to run on PC.)

This project is still being developed and tested. I will try to provide the most detailed and readable code and comments as possible. Hope this is helpful!
